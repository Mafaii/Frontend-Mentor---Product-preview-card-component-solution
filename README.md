## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- to clip image to parent/container (corners) overflow: hidden can be used
- buttons are annoying cuz margin does not move them (at least in config that i tried)
- when everyting is put in place with classes in html then css is quite easier and faster to write
